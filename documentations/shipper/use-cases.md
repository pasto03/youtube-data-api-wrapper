# Shipper Use Cases

This document provides practical examples of when and how to use shippers.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Export to JSON

```python
from yt_pipeline.foreman import ChannelsForeman
import json

foreman = ChannelsForeman()
shipper = foreman.invoke(
    iterable=["UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw"],
    developerKey=devKey
)

# Export main records
with open("channels.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(shipper.main_records, f, indent=2)

# Export thumbnails separately
with open("thumbnails.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(shipper.thumbnails, f, indent=2)
```

### Pattern 2: Export to CSV

```python
import csv

shipper = foreman.invoke(...)

# Export main records
with open("channels.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=shipper.main_records[0].keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(shipper.main_records)
```

### Pattern 3: Data Analysis

```python
shipper = foreman.invoke(...)

# Analyze data
total_views = sum(int(record['viewCount']) for record in shipper.main_records)
average_views = total_views / len(shipper.main_records)

print(f"Total Views: {total_views}")
print(f"Average Views: {average_views}")
```

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Channel Data Export

```python
from yt_pipeline.foreman import ChannelsForeman
import json

foreman = ChannelsForeman()
shipper = foreman.invoke(
    iterable=["UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw"],
    developerKey=devKey,
    backup_shipper=True  # Automatic backup
)

# Access data
for record in shipper.main_records:
    print(f"Channel: {record['title']}")
    print(f"Subscribers: {record['subscriberCount']}")

    # Access thumbnails
    thumbnails = shipper.thumbnails[record['id']]
    for thumb in thumbnails:
        print(f"  {thumb['quality']}: {thumb['url']}")
```

### Example 2: Video Analytics Export

```python
from yt_pipeline.foreman import VideosForeman
import json

foreman = VideosForeman()
shipper = foreman.invoke(
    iterable=["dQw4w9WgXcQ", "jNQXAC9IVRw"],
    developerKey=devKey
)

# Export for analysis
with open("videos.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(shipper.main_records, f, indent=2)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use for Export** — Shippers are ideal for exporting data
2. **Separate Thumbnails** — Thumbnails are separated for better organization
3. **Enable Backup** — Use `backup_shipper=True` for automatic backups
4. **Use Containers for Programmatic Access** — Use containers when you need structured access

## When to Use Shippers vs Containers

### Use Shippers When:

- Exporting data to JSON/CSV
- Working with flat data structures
- Need simple dictionary access
- Separating thumbnails from main data

### Use Containers When:

- Need type-safe, structured access
- Want to preserve relationships
- Working programmatically with data
- Need IDE autocomplete
